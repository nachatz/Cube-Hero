Open world 2D RPG game. The user is allowed to pick between three weapons: sword, bow, or staves. Their weapons will progress with a weapon level and will upgrade at certain intervals. The user also holds a TruLevel which determines their overall level in the case they decide to change their weapon. The user is then allowed to explore the world, fight bosses, and level up to become stronger.
